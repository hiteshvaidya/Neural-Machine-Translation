# Neural-Machine-Translation

This repository contains part of the literature survey that I have been doing in NMT. It contains PPTs on various research papers. I will keep on adding either PPTs or gists on new research papers in future.
If you are starting with Neural Machine Translation for the first time, it is recommended to first read [Bahdanau et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) and [Sutskever et al.,2014](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf).This is because, almost each and every research papers in NMT cites both these papers. So, it is better to have read these papers in advancce.

## PPTs on paper that I have added so far to this repo
1. Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation
2. A Teacher-Student Framework for Zero-Resource Neural Machine Translation
3. Improved Neural Machine Translation with Source Syntax
4. Google_s Neural Machine Translation System_ Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation (incomplete)
